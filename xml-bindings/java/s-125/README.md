# S-125 - GLA Research & Development
This repository contains some preliminary work on the IHO S-125 standardization
product, performed by the UK's General Lighthouse Authority Research and 
Development Directorate.

*NO NOT USE THIS ON PRODUCTION*

The purpose of this repository is to just be used as a reference during the
S-125 standardization process.

## General Information
This repository is actually a Maven project. It currently contains the latest
definition of the S-125 data product, along with the associate S-100 structure
definitions in the project's resources folder.

[src/main/resources/xsd/S100/5.0.0/S100GML/20220620/s100gmlbase.xsd](src/main/resources/xsd/S100/5.0.0/S100GML/20220620/s100gmlbase.xsd)

[src/main/resources/xsd/S100/5.0.0/S100GML/20220620/S100_gmlProfile.xsd](src/main/resources/xsd/S100/5.0.0/S100GML/20220620/S100_gmlProfile.xsd)

[src/main/resources/xsd/S-125.xsd](src/main/resources/xsd/S-125.xsd)

Apart from the S-125 definition, this project can also be used as a Java 
dependency after it is built with Maven. Using JAXB it can parse the S-125
xsd definition and produce a list of Java objects to parse the S-125 message
in a Java service. Handy... right?
