# S-100-xmlbindings
The purpose of the repository is to provide xml-bindings for S-100 standards in various programming languages

⚠️ Disclaimer:
The current implementation of the XML bindings is intended only for testing and analysis. NIPWG will review the usability of these XML bindings at VTC3’25 and, hopefully, approve a way forward. In the meantime, everyone is welcome to experiment with the files in the repository and provide feedback via GitHub issues.

## Overview

This repository provides language bindings for the S-100 standard, making it easier for developers to work with S-100 datasets across different programming languages. These bindings allow you to programmatically interact with S-100-compliant datasets and data models, supporting the creation of applications that need to process, validate, and manipulate S-100 data.

The S-100 standard, developed by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), is the framework for electronic navigational charts, hydrographic data, and other maritime-related geospatial information. These bindings are designed to facilitate integration of S-100 data into modern applications without the complexity of directly handling S-100 specifications.

⚠️ Warning: 
This repository is not an official IHO document or service. It has been created solely to support collaboration within the S-100 community.

## Why Use This Repository?

By providing language bindings, this repository simplifies the interaction with S-100 datasets for developers. Whether you're building marine navigation systems, environmental monitoring tools, or GIS applications, these bindings enable:

* Easy access to S-100 datasets across multiple programming languages.
* Simplified development of software solutions that adhere to S-100 standards.
* Interoperability with other tools and services that support or produce S-100-compliant data.

## Supported Languages

The following languages are currently planned to be supported: Java
If you require support for additional languages, we welcome contributions and feature requests.

 ## Key Features

* Dataset Parsing: Easily load and interpret S-100 datasets.
* Validation: Automatically validate S-100 data against the official S-100 schemas.
* Data Manipulation: Create and modify S-100 datasets through high-level APIs.
